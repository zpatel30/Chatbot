# Chatbot
Mini project for Machine Learning

We have created a chabot as a part of our Software Group Project as well as the mini project for Machine Learning (CS344). 
Chatbot was created using python from scratch. It answers queries related to the internship portal which is prepared by us for SGP.

Some pre-requisites for this project are:-
- nltk
- numpy
- keras
- tensorflow
- pickle
- tkinter

It uses tkinter for formation of GUI for the conversation.
